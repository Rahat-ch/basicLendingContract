# About

This is a basic Lending contract that deploys an ERC20 Token and allows a user to deposit collatoral and recive a 50% loan based on that collatoral.

This code was developed live during a workshop and can be deployed in Remix(https://remix.ethereum.org/) for testing. 

Original deployment was done on the Polygon Proof of Stake Blockchain.
